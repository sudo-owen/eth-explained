              Let's get started.
            </p>
              
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a <Vocab>blockchain network</Vocab> for <Vocab>sending money</Vocab> and <Vocab>running apps</Vocab>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What does that mean?
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In general, a <Vocab>network</Vocab> is a group of connected things, like a social network. As long as something is in the network, you can reach it. Just like how on the Facebook network, you can send a message to anyone as long as they have an account.
            </p>
            
            {/* Network Animation */}
            <div className="my-12">

            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              (I know we didn't define <Vocab>blockchain</Vocab> yet, don't worry, we'll get to it.)
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Like a social media network, you'll need an <Vocab>account</Vocab> to get started using Ethereum. An account will let you receive <Vocab>money</Vocab>. You can receive many types of digital assets with your account.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Let's give you a test account to get started:
            </p>

            <div className="my-12">
              <BalanceComponent className="max-w-md mx-auto" />
            </div>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Every account has a unique ID, called an <Vocab>address</Vocab>. Your simulated address is <code className="bg-gray-800 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm break-all">0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2</code>. Just like how an email address lets you receive emails on the internet, your Ethereum address lets you receive ETH on the Ethereum network.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              What is ETH? ETH is the native currency of the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoin, it's another digital currency that you can trade or transfer.

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
               Here, let's give you 1 (simulated) ETH to get started below.

            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              So far you have sent {totalAmountSent.toFixed(4)} ETH. Nice! After sending ETH, we get the pop-up below. What does it mean?
            </p>

            {/* Dummy Transaction Modal */}
            <div className="my-12">

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Once it turns green, your sent transaction has been <Vocab>confirmed</Vocab>. This lets you know that it was successful, i.e. that it went through.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Sending money on Ethereum isn't instant. It's faster than a bank transfer (no need to wait 1-2 business days), but it's also a little slower than Venmo or Zelle.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Specifically, on Ethereum, it takes <Vocab>up to 12 seconds</Vocab> to complete a transaction.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Does this mean we can only take one action on Ethereum every 12 seconds? If so, that would be inconvenient.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What if we have to send money to multiple people? Do we need to send first to Alice, wait 12 seconds, then send to Bob, wait, and so on?
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Thankfully, not quite.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              On Ethereum, we can send out multiple transactions to different accounts. Then, in around 12 seconds, they'll all happen one after another in quick succession.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              How does that work? Here's an example.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Imagine that we're at a train station, and we want to deliver some packages to the next stop. If we have multiple packages to deliver, we can still put them all on the same train, and they'll all get delivered together at the next stop.
            </p>

            {/* Train Animation */}
            <div className="my-12">
              <TrainAnimation />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Of course, instead of packages we're sending ETH. And instead of waiting for the next train, we're waiting at most 12 seconds for our transactions to go through.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But why does it take 12 seconds at all? Why isn't it instant?
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              It's because of something called <Vocab>block time</Vocab>. On Ethereum, it takes about 12 seconds for the network to create a <Vocab>block</Vocab>.
              <FootnoteRef id="speedup">
                  On average, it's probably closer to 6 seconds, so the animations you see are actually running at 2x speed. But don't worry about this too much.
              </FootnoteRef>This "block" is what makes up the word "blockchain."
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              But what <i>is</i> a block?
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Think of a block like a train in the animation above. The train arrives on schedule, picks up everyone's transactions, then leaves for its destination.

              When we send out all these different transactions, they get collected into a <Vocab>block</Vocab>. So a block is a list of all the transactions that have happened. And a new block gets published around every 12 seconds.
